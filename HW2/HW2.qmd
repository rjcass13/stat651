# 1: BDA3 2.10ab

$\pi(N) = (.01)(.99)^{N-1}$ ($N>1, 2, 3...$)

a) We see 203. What is the posterior for actual number of roadcars?

Thinking about what the distirbution of $P(203|N)$, if there were 203 cars, $P(203|N) = 1/203$. If there were 204, it would be $1\204$, etc. For any $N$ less than 203 we coldn't have seen a 203, so it's 0. Thus:

$P(203|N) = \frac{1}{N}$ for $N \ge 203$

$P(N|203) \propto P(203|N)\pi(N) = \frac{1}{N}(.01)(.99)^{N-1} = \frac{1}{N}(.01)(.99)(.99)^{N} \propto \frac{1}{N}(.99)^{N}$
